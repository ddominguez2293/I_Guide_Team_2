Burn Area Analysis – Pantanal 2024

This project uses GeoAI to study wildfires in the Pantanal wetlands during May–July 2024.
It combines satellite data, climate reanalysis, and land-use information to build models that predict where fires are likely to occur.

What’s Included

Data preprocessing (MODIS Burn Area, WorldCover, NASADEM, ERA5)

Baseline models: Random Forest, XGBoost, TabNet

Spatiotemporal model: ConvLSTM for burn progression

Scripts and notebooks for training, evaluation, and visualization

How to Run

Use the Jupyter notebooks in notebooks/ to follow the workflow step by step.

Inset notebooks here

Or run scripts (e.g. train_baseline.py, train_convlstm.py) for model training.

Outputs (figures, gifs, model results) will be saved in the outputs/ folder.
